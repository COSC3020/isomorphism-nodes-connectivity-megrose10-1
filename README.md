# Isomorphism

Prove that if two graphs $A$ and $B$ have the same number of nodes and are
completely connected, they must be isomorphic. I have started with the formal
definition of isomorphism below. Add your answer to this markdown file. [This
page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)
might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.

$G_1=(V_1 , E_1)$ is isomorphic to $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ if there exists a
one-to-one and onto function (bijection) $f: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ such that $(u,v)
\in E_1$ iff $(f(u),f(v)) \in E_2$.

To prove that these two graphs, who are both completely connected and have the same amount of nodes, are isomorphic and will always be isomorphic, we must look at a couple things. First, mapping. When mapping these two graphs, you can pair any node with any other node. Since they all essentially connect to each other, it will not matter which node you map it to. Each node with be mapped to one node, and this will go for every node, hence the one-to-one. Since the structure is preserved in completely connected same node number graphs, these are isomorphic.


I used the class slides and video on graphing. I also got help from the TA in lab and office hours.
