# Isomorphism

Prove that if two graphs $A$ and $B$ have the same number of nodes and are
completely connected, they must be isomorphic. I have started with the formal
definition of isomorphism below. Add your answer to this markdown file. [This
page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)
might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.

$G_1=(V_1 , E_1)$ is isomorphic to $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ if there exists a
one-to-one and onto function (bijection) $f: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ such that $(u,v)
\in E_1$ iff $(f(u),f(v)) \in E_2$.

To prove that these two graphs, who are both completely connected and have the same amount of nodes, are isomorphic and will always be isomorphic, we want to see if there is a one-to-one and onto fucntion. Since completely connected graphs are connected to every node in the graph, we can map any node from graph 1 to a unique node in graph 2, this leads to us repeating this until we find they have the same structure. Since all nodes will be connected, a bijection does exist. With a function like f, we can translate these nodes from their current names, and we will have the same structue. To conclude, we, by the above description, can say any graphs that are completely connected and have the same amount of nodes must be isomorphic.


I used the class slides and video on graphing. I also got help from the TA in lab and office hours. I also spoke with you during office hours after class.
